# React Three Fiber 3D Animation Project

This project is a demonstration of using [React Three Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber), a React renderer for Three.js, to create 3D animations in web applications. It explores various 3D objects, materials, and animations using the React Three Fiber library along with additional libraries like [@react-three/drei](https://github.com/react-spring/drei) and [leva](https://github.com/pmndrs/leva).

## Project Overview

- **Components:**
  - **Cube:** A 3D cube that rotates and moves along the z-axis.
  - **Sphere:** A 3D sphere that reacts to hover and click events.
  - **Torus:** A 3D torus with rotation animation.
  - **TorusKnot:** A 3D torus knot with wobbling animation.

- **Lighting:**
  - Directional light with shadow casting.
  - Ambient light for overall scene illumination.

- **Controls:**
  - Use of [@react-three/drei](https://github.com/react-spring/drei) for additional controls like OrbitControls.
  - Use of [leva](https://github.com/pmndrs/leva) for interactive UI controls.

## Getting Started
